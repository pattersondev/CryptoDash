This crypto dashboard was made with the help of Ania Kubow. Here is the link to her video which was very helpful(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwhJNbWka0)

The dashboard displays crypto news that is pulled from the Crypto News Live api, and it also converts currencies for you thanks to the Alpha Vantage api.

There's not too much else to explain here, take a look at the code and tell me what I can do better.
